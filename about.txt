How to Read the Story: 
'A Series of Unfortunate Choices' is an interactive novella that has several endings and nearly countless paths intertwined throughout its world. Readers are able to pick one of four locations to start their adventure right off the bat and can spend anywhere from one to fifteen minutes before reaching a conclusion. Re-reading and exploring all of the choices presented in the story is stressed as a way to get the most out of the CYOA experience. 

Artistic statement / Introduction: 
'A Series of Unfortunate Choices' was built using our interactive storytelling platform that allows a reader to experience the novella in the ‘choose your own adventure’ style. Inspired by the genre of books that included 'Reader Beware: Choose Your Own Scare!' Goosebumps, Kelsie and Jeff set out to re-imagine the fun and dynamism of this form of storytelling using digital media. Readers are presented with an exciting adventure story that changes every time they read it based on their choices at every turn. The novella features countless twists and turns, random choices, and several endings that reward the reader for their diligence.
