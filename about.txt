How to Read the Story:
'A Series of Unfortunate Choices' is an interactive novella that has 
several endings and numerous paths intertwined throughout its
world. Readers are able to pick one of four starting locations to begin
their adventure and can spend anywhere from one to ten minutes
before reaching a conclusion. Re-reading and exploring all of the
choices presented in the story is stressed as a way to get the most
out of the CYOA experience.

Vision:
'A Series of Unfortunate Choices' was built using our interactive
storytelling platform that allows a reader to experience the
novella in the 'choose your own adventure', or CYOA, style.
Inspired by the genre of books that included 'Reader Beware:
Choose Your Own Scare!' Goosebumps, Kelsie and Jeff
set out to re-imagine the fun and suspense of this form of
storytelling using digital media.
